Deep Learning Networks with Pytorch.

One can Run this notebook directly in Google Collab(https://colab.research.google.com/), with just an installing pytorch on colab, which is provided in Notebook Already!

This Note book demonstrate about the effects of different methods of Regularization effects on the Neural networks like.
1. L1 and L2 Regularization.
One can refer this Blog about how L1 and L2 as a loss function and regularization--http://www.chioka.in/differences-between-l1-and-l2-as-loss-function-and-regularization/

2. Affects of Pruning on the weights.

3. Also Demonstrates the Batch normalization implementation using Pytorch and effects of BN.
This is the actual Paper where technique of Batch Normalization is used for regularization --https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00846
